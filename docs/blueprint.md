# **App Name**: AquaTrace

## Core Features:

- Data Import & Asset Assignment: Upload CSV datafiles, assign them to specific geospatial assets, and manage asset details including permanent pool elevation and multi-year design elevations.
- Column Mapping: Automatically detect relevant columns in uploaded datafiles for water level information and allow users to confirm or manually map the data columns.
- Weather Data Integration: Connect to weather services via APIs to automatically fetch and integrate precipitation data for specified geospatial assets, harmonizing with water level data.
- Data Harmonization: Store data and standardize timestamp resolutions from various different sources into one unified view of the dataset, handling for gaps in source data as needed.
- Rule-Based Analysis: Apply pre-determined rules to cross-reference water level and precipitation data to identify potential issues such as blocked assets, leaks, and deviations from stormwater management design best practices.
- Reporting: Generate polished PDF reports containing analysis results, data visualizations, and identified issues for each asset.
- Deployment Management: Associate time series with deployments for particular sensor locations, managing deployments with the associated geospatial asset.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#336633), reflecting nature and water management.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), creating a neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Earthy orange (#D2691E), for calls to action and data highlights.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, to be used for all main app content and informational sections.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif font to be used for headers in all dashboard panels and information blurbs.
- Use clear, easily recognizable icons for data types, actions, and alerts.
- Dashboard layout with clear sections for data visualization, asset information, and analysis results.
- Subtle transitions for data loading and report generation.
